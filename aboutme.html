<p>  Welcome to my personal website!!! My name is Tsering Lama and I'm a 16
  year old Tibetan resident in NYC. I'm creating this website while
  attending a Summer internship at Girls Who Code in Viacom NYC. My website
  will include fun information about me as well as reviews on different
  products, shows, movies, and songs. Most of the movies, shows, and songs
  will be Korean, however, I'll review anything you guy comment down below this
  page. Information about me will include my ethnicity and spreading awareness
  on the genocide in Tibet. As well as information on my journey as a high
  school wrestler and why you should join. I hope you enjoy my content and
  I will update the page every Monday and Wednesday!!!
